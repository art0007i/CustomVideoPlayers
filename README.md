# CustomVideoPlayers

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to select a custom video player from your inventory and have it spawn whenever a video is imported.

This mod implements the feature from [#2535](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/2535)

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [CustomVideoPlayers.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/CustomVideoPlayers/releases/latest/download/CustomVideoPlayers.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
